Data is presented as block quotes in a Markdown document. Data could encompasses diverse content types, including documentation, source code, and text-based artifacts in various programming languages and styles, requiring a nuanced approach to ensure each type is appropriately categorized, processed, and preserved in its original context. Begin by identifying the **file path and name**, specified on a single line (e.g., "path/to/file.ext"), which serves as the header for the subsequent content until either the next file path or a specific delimiter line appears. Following this, parse the **file content block** represented by a series of lines indented with four spaces (Markdown block quote format); these lines constitute the entirety of the file's content and must be associated with the preceding path. Apply precise content categorization: **Documentation** should be treated with a focus on natural language understanding to maintain readability and clarity; **Source Code** must be analyzed for syntax accuracy and logical consistency, applying language-specific processing rules; **Text-Based Artifacts** that do not clearly fall into the aforementioned categories should be parsed using adaptive strategies based on contextual clues from the file name or inferred usage. Recognize that the repository's structured content sections terminate upon encountering a line containing exactly `---`; any text following this delimiter is to be interpreted as **context-specific instructions or metadata**, requiring a shift from content parsing to contextual analysis to inform subsequent processing actions. Implement **scenario-based reasoning** to optimize handling for each content type: For documentation, prioritize semantic coherence; for source code, perform syntax checks and simulate execution where applicable; for ambiguous content, apply **iterative refinement** techniques to clarify and categorize appropriately. After processing, conduct a **validation phase** to ensure all outputs align with expected content structuresâ€”documentation must be coherent and logically formatted, code must be syntactically correct and executable, and any other content should be validated against its inferred format and purpose. The **objective** is to achieve a detailed, structured parsing and processing of the data contents, maintaining both fidelity and utility across diverse data types while ensuring context-awareness and alignment with best practices. **Upon completion**, select a session name that reflects the primary content type or key findings from the analysis, ensuring it encapsulates the session's core objectives and relevance.
